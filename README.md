  A decentralized Minecraft server powered by Cloudflare services (WIP)
</h2>

## Why?
Not everybody own a server, or have the money to host a Minecraft server, or crazy enough to run the server on their machine for the whole day, even when they're not playing. Free server provider usually really bad in performace, sketchy and not close to some countries. Creating the whole experience fills with lags, low TPS, can't customize plugins & mods... It's a nightmare.

Then I think, why not make the server "decentralized", anyone could host the server, of course it will have security and stuff to prevent bad actors, and you can select who can host it.

You should only allow someone you trust to use this to host your server, if someone delete some files, it will be a permanent change.

## DIY
There are two things you must do for it to work:
- Setup [**MCCL Workers**](https://github.com/Neurs12/MCCL-workers).
- Distribute your version of [**MCCL Client**](https://github.com/Neurs12/MCCL-client).
